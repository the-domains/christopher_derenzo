This facility was a restaurant by day and a jazz club by evening. The establishment used to be a Piccadilly cafeteria before the lease changed hands and the new owners wanted to bring a sip of jazz into the area. This was a great learning experience for me professionally which required a custom sized 350-gallon salt water aquarium installed in the entry with a complete audio/ video system for live entertainment. I know some might ask, “what do A/V systems and aquariums have in common?” For me personally these were passions of mine, both saltwater tanks and A/V systems, but I had never built and installed them together in the same place… Professionally it happens to be mechanical engineering that ties these two interests together… From designing, measuring, material selection and constructing for each application there were a number of common tools, materials and vendors. As always there were challenges that charged me physically and mentally to accomplish this task in a small window of time (per the norm)!</p>,<p>I sent my plans to a number of companies with a strong desire for safety and visibility without support structures hindering our view. considering what kind of an environment this was going to be and found one that was willing to take on the challenge and unique  with a local glass manufacturing company to develop the Aquarium Glass  with exact specs to meet the dimensions and needs for this install. We worked together to perform stress tests and verify proper sealant around all of the seams. What was most valuable in this process was all of the important insight that a couple of professionals in the field were kind enough to share with me while undertaking such a risky task… For example, considering budget and materials available to the average contractor, it is extremely important to provide a “near-perfect” flat surface under the bottom of the tank as apposed to open frame support. This would prevent the weight of the water (approximately 3-tons) from stressing the 3/4” glass to. What I found to complete this task was a self leveling concrete floor approximately with an uncut foam board to provide support for the underside of the tank weighing in at .</p>,<p> I hand crafted the steel TV mounts and Speaker mounts for all of the AV to be located in the ceilings and off of the floor (minus some subs situated under the front of the stage. I installed very basic moving head fixtures  lighting effects and an audio system to cater to live performances. They asked me to install all of the subs in the ceilings so as not to appear like a club and free up as much floor space as possible. I was lucky to live right next to this establishment as the Aquarium was an ongoing personal hobby of mine which required weekly maintenance and daily feeding since there were no automated feeders in this unit.</p>]]></description>
