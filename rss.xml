I was asked to design stronger machine for testing and research to proceed past the prototyping stage. Both previous machines were much smaller than what the customer was looking for so I made a plan to build one structure which could be bolted together and extended to the 18’ which was needed for the application. This was more durable in the end and provided us with the information we needed to proceed with engineering a solution capable of meeting the demands of the client. I worked to develop smoother and more efficient operations on this rendition. I initially set it up with manual operation of stepper motors, actuators, and solenoids with a custom built remote to control the unit until all of the clearances were in order. Then I built an automated system with an Arduino microprocessor and sensors that were installed all across the machine to detect those clearances and perform operations requested by the iOS device.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4dd9adaf-fc10-4df4-b5d9-a12ef9b04718.jpg" title="Prototype Board - Top Side showing 555 Timer for manual control and input pins with LED&apos;s for the switches installed around machine.">]]></description>
