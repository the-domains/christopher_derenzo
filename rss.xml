            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d281a6d-e0ef-435f-8053-04d552db2ed8.jpg" title="My First Custom 350 Gal Aquarium" alt="with custom A/V install">,<p>South Beach Bistro - Atlanta, GA (2005). This facility was a restaurant by day and a jazz club by evening. The establishment used to be a Piccadilly cafeteria before the lease changed hands and the new owners wanted to bring a sip of jazz into the area. This was a great learning experience for me professionally which required a custom sized 350-gallon salt water aquarium installed in the entry with a complete audio/ video system for live entertainment. I know some might ask, “what do these have in common?” For me personally these were passions of mine both saltwater tanks and A/V systems, but never together in the same place… Professionally it happens to be mechanical engineering… From designing to measuring, weighing and material selection for each application. There was a great deal of challenges that I had to overcome to accomplish this task</p>,<p>I outsourced the Aquarium Glass work to a local glass company with exact specs to meet the dimensions and needs for this install. What was most valuable in this process was all of the important insight that a couple of professionals in the field were kind enough to share with me while undertaking such a risky task… For example, considering budget and materials available to the average contractor, it is extremely important to provide a “near-perfect” flat surface under the bottom of the tank as apposed to open frame support. This would prevent the weight of the water (approximately 3-tons) from stressing the 3/4” glass to. What I found to complete this task was a self leveling concrete floor approximately with an uncut foam board to provide support for the underside of the tank weighing in at .</p>,<p> I hand crafted the steel TV mounts and Speaker mounts for all of the AV to be located in the ceilings and off of the floor (minus some subs situated under the front of the stage. I installed very basic moving head fixtures  lighting effects and an audio system to cater to live performances. They asked me to install all of the subs in the ceilings so as not to appear like a club and free up as much floor space as possible. I was lucky to live right next to this establishment as the Aquarium was an ongoing personal hobby of mine which required weekly maintenance and daily feeding since there were no automated feeders in this unit.</p>]]></description>
