The facility was a Piccadilly cafeteria before the lease changed hands and the new tenant envisioned a unique establishment in the neighborhood that would provide a dine-in restaurant by day and a jazz club by evening.</p>,<p>This was a great opportunity for me professionally because of the skills I would acquire with a variety of materials used in the construction process. Plastic, glass, wood and steel fixtures were custom tailored for each part of the install process. These are skills which I take pride in and still carry with me today.</p>,<p>While designing and building a custom 350-gallon salt water aquarium, I did what I did best at the time and also installed a very basic audio/ video system for live entertainment. I know some might ask, “what do A/V systems and aquariums have in common?” For me personally, these were passions of mine, both saltwater tanks and professional audio video systems, but I had never built and installed them together in the same space. Professionally it happens to be mechanical engineering that ties these two interests of mine together… From design to completion, each application presented a series of challenges that stimulated me mentally and physically and to accomplish these tasks in a small window of time, per the norm, I felt that I succeeded when all items were inspected by the inspector and the work I had been tasked with met code. The restaurant opened for business on time and under budget!</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/853d5064-f932-4d4b-96df-2d2e7f3bfe1e.jpg" alt="Before initial testing">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/469e76ab-2530-4301-bfd8-b8e4a753177d.jpg" alt="The sump!">,<p>The Aquarium:</p>,<p>I sent my plans to a number of companies in the surrounding area with two major needs: (1) Safety - considering the size and location. (2) Visibility - as unobstructed as possible. I started the hunt for glass distributors and manufacturers and found this would not be an easy task. After coming close to calling it quits I found a qualified glass manufacturer further off the beaten path that was able and ready to supply me with the glass. We worked together during the cutting stage and construction stage then performed the stress tests and verified proper support and sealant around all of the frameless seams. Then I added a steel 1” square tube around the top and bottom for additional support to prevent any separation without blocking the view with vertical supports. The gravity fed sump was underneath the tank placed in between the 4x4 supports so I placed an overflow box into the center of the tank which would also return the filtered water with 3 pumps to process ~1600GPH. What fun this was to make!</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/17cf564e-d231-4253-ab8f-3171f05fc97e.jpg">,<p>Consider how important it is to provide a “near-perfect” solid flat surface under the bottom of the tank as apposed to open frame support or just a piece of ply. This would prevent the weight of the water (approximately 3-tons) from pressing against a small deformation or open space created over time that could eventually lead to failure of the bottom layer of glass. What I found to complete this task was a self leveling concrete application applied approximately 1/2” layer over the top of the piece of plywood I was originally going to use with the insulation board to provide a cushion underneath the glass.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a5b8d90b-b3ab-4f3a-807f-78daf87e8020.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb55175d-1703-4ce6-baf9-fc776582234d.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e96152b5-a3a6-4936-8a35-d7ff9b8579ac.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/abbc94c6-ac7b-4273-bc05-e5fdb5e52ab8.jpg" alt="After two weeks it was ready to add fish!">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/97a8d56b-5639-4649-89fa-f5b820fa6093.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bffc8f2d-c943-4e20-b38b-66d95426bf93.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ca4647f-ec5c-462b-9798-ad12205b069c.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0994f38d-14c0-4279-9b23-276228d6363a.jpg">,<p>I hand crafted the steel TV mounts and Speaker mounts for all of the AV to be located in the ceilings and off of the floor (minus some subs situated under the front of the stage. I installed very basic moving head fixtures lighting effects and an audio system to cater to live performances. They asked me to install all of the subs in the ceilings so as not to appear like a club and free up as much floor space as possible.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/55d6929b-b414-4df8-ac91-7ff248ea9a00.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/63a7bbce-7a9a-4f8a-ab09-9924c29615db.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92745f4c-3142-4dc9-9f08-27679cdf20b8.jpg">]]></description>
