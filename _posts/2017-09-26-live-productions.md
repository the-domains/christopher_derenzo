Live Productions - My work in the production world started in the club industry but has spanned across all aspects of live entertainment and recording studios. These productions usually required the complete setup and tear down of: 

Trussing, Power, Tents, Stages, Water Features, Lighting, Sound, and Video devices to accommodate tens of people to tens of thousands of people. A great deal of my work relied upon physical operation and/or project management to successfully complete these projects within the timeline provided by the customer. Each project was unique and presented different sets of challenges... most tasks were an exercise of efficiency, professionalism and creative thinking to accommodate each clients needs! No project was too great or small!
