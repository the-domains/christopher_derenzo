South Beach Bistro - Atlanta, GA (2005). The facility was a Piccadilly cafeteria before the lease changed hands and the new tenant envisioned a unique establishment in the neighborhood that would provide a dine-in restaurant by day and a jazz club by evening. 

This was a great opportunity for me professionally because of the skills I would acquire with a variety of materials used in the construction process. Plastic, glass, wood and steel fixtures were custom tailored for each part of the install process. These are skills which I take pride in and still carry with me today.

While designing and building a custom sized 350-gallon salt water aquarium that was on display to each person walking through the front door, I did what I did best at the time and installed a custom audio/ video system for live entertainment in this space. I know some might ask, "what do A/V systems and aquariums have in common?" For me personally, these were passions of mine, both saltwater tanks and professional audio video systems, but I had never built and installed them together in the same space or time. Professionally it happens to be mechanical engineering that ties these two interests of mine together... From design to completion, each application presented a series of challenges that stimulated me mentally and physically and to accomplish these tasks in a small window of time, per the norm, I felt that I succeeded when all items were inspected by an official city inspector inspector and the work I had been tasked with met code. The restaurant opened for business on time and under budget!

The Aquarium:

I sent my plans to a number of companies in the surrounding area with two major needs: (1) Safety - considering the size and location. (2) Visibility - as unobstructed by additional support mechanisms that would hinder the view. Not many companies would take the risk, nor over engineer it, however, persistence paid off when I found one company that understood their product well enough to stand behind their materials and abilities for this application. We worked together during the cutting stage and construction stage then performed the stress tests and verified proper support and sealant around all of the frameless seams. What a beautiful aquarium this turned out to be!

What was most valuable in this process was all of the experience that a number of professionals in the field were kind enough to share with me while undertaking such a risky task... For example, considering it is extremely important to provide a "near-perfect" solid flat surface under the bottom of the tank as apposed to open frame support or just a piece of ply. This would prevent the weight of the water (approximately 3-tons) from pressing against a small deformation or open space that could eventually lead to failure of the bottom layer of glass. What I found to complete this task was a self leveling concrete floor approximately 1/2" thick over top of that piece of plywood. with an uncut foam board to provide support for the underside of the tank weighing in at .

I hand crafted the steel TV mounts and Speaker mounts for all of the AV to be located in the ceilings and off of the floor (minus some subs situated under the front of the stage. I installed very basic moving head fixtures lighting effects and an audio system to cater to live performances. They asked me to install all of the subs in the ceilings so as not to appear like a club and free up as much floor space as possible. I was lucky to live right next to this establishment as the Aquarium was an ongoing personal hobby of mine which required weekly maintenance and daily feeding since there were no automated feeders in this unit.
