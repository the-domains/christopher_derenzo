  This Building is located in the heart of Century City, CA and stands 42
  stories tall. It was a two-year build out with three underground parking
  levels, two amenity floors and forty residential floors. I managed the future
  proofing responsibilities and installation of low-voltage technologies
  throughout the building. My team and I installed all of Carlon® flexible
  raceway tubing for the residential units to the home networking centers
  centrally located in each unit. In the Penthouses we installed Stealth
  Acoustics® invisible speakers throughout all of the rooms and ran plenum
  rated: fiber, Cresnet®, speaker, and cat 6 cables for home technologies based
  on the customers specific needs. The buildings common areas included: a
  theater, pool, gym, gardens and lobbies where we installed a Crestron
  controlled system to provide communications and entertainment for these
  amenities.

# Project Management:

This Building is located in the heart of Century City, CA and stands 42 stories tall. It was a two-year build out with three underground parking levels, two amenity floors and forty residential floors. I managed the future proofing responsibilities and installation of low-voltage technologies throughout the building. My team and I installed all of Carlon(r) flexible raceway tubing for the residential units to the home networking centers centrally located in each unit. In the Penthouses we installed Stealth Acoustics(r) invisible speakers throughout all of the rooms and ran plenum rated: fiber, Cresnet(r), speaker, and cat 6 cables for home technologies based on the customers specific needs. The buildings common areas included: a theater, pool, gym, gardens and lobbies where we installed a Crestron controlled system to provide communications and entertainment for these amenities.
