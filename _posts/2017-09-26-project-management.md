This building is located in the heart of Century City and stands 42 stories tall. It was a four year project with three underground parking levels, two amenity floors and 39 residential floors. My responsibility was to lead teams to install conduit, Carlon(r) flexible raceway tubing and low-voltage cabling for telecommunications, environmental and AV systems to centrally distributed network centers throughout the structure. I worked closely with other trades to accomplish these tasks and coordinate my teams efforts to follow the schedule provided by the developer. I maintained/ modified plans while compiling as built documentation for the developer and future tenants. The buildings common areas included: a theater, pool, gym, gardens and lobbies where we integrated a custom automated control system with user interfaces and components to provide communication of environment and entertainment devices for these amenities.

Conduit was run through concrete to conceal our cables for the installation...

As the concrete was poured, we worked our way up each floor of the building along side each of the contractors to future proof the building with conduit tubing.

Once the last floor was completed, we then moved in to the installation phase which meant we had ramp down the rough work and ramp up the finishing work.
