This Building is located in the heart of Century City, CA and stands 42 stories tall. It was a four year plan with three underground parking levels, two amenity floors and forty residential floors. I led two teams to install conduit, Carlon(r) flexible raceway tubing and low-voltage cabling as the backbone for all telecommunications to demarcation points throughout the structure. I worked closely with the developer to accomplish these tasks and coordinate with my teams to maintain a rigorous yet obtainable schedule. I developed plans for the d-marcs (strategically located through out the building) to tie into home networking centers centrally located in each unit to connect to the tubing spread out through the units. The buildings common areas included: a theater, pool, gym, gardens and lobbies where we installed a Crestron controlled system to provide communications and entertainment for these amenities.

Conduit was run through concrete to conceal our cables for the installation...

As the concrete was poured, we worked our way up each floor of the building along side each of the contractors to future proof the entire building.

In the Penthouses we installed Stealth Acoustics(r) invisible speakers throughout all of the rooms and ran plenum rated: fiber, Cresnet(r) and other cables for home technologies based on the customers specific needs.

Once the last floor was completed, we then moved in to the installation phase which ment we had to scale down the forces till tenants actually started to move in.
