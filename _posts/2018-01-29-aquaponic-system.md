Aquaponic System

This project stemmed from the successes of previous projects to create a 99% autonomous eco system for fish and plants with the help of an Arduino for environmental controls.

The materials used for this project were mostly spare and used parts from past projects. From basic construction and thoughtful design to intricate wiring and calculated plumbing, power and air flow helped complete this fully automated aquaponic system.

The beginning started with a 150 gallon Aquarium and some lights just sitting around in the garage. Then the purchase of a 3' x 5' x 6.5' tent w/ extras ($100) and a light fixture ($150)...

I anticipated building out a small framed in room, however the cost of the tent was more affordable and was sufficient for the space available!

After putting the aquarium together and powering the tent with everything needed to control the environment inside the tent I started then started to automate the system with supplies sitting around in boxes.

Relays, modified outlets and surge protectors on two points... Boxes to house the components and connectors to clean up and protect all connections:

There is nothing like standing on a ladder to solder connections!
