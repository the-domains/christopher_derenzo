# Aquaponic System (personal)(2018)

This project stemmed from the successes of previous projects to create a 99% autonomous eco system for fish and plants with the help of an Arduino for environmental controls.

The materials used for this project were mostly spare and used parts from past projects. From basic construction and thoughtful design to intricate wiring and calculated plumbing, power and air flow helped complete this fully automated aquaponic system.

The beginning started with a 150 gallon Aquarium and some lights just sitting around in the garage.

Then the purchase of a 3' x 5' x 6.5' tent w/ extras ($100) and a LED light fixture ($150)...

I anticipated building out a small framed in room, however the cost of the tent with extras was more affordable and sufficient for the space I had available!

After putting the aquarium together and powering the tent with everything needed to control the environment inside the tent I then started to automate the system with spare supplies sitting around.

Snip the tab on the common side to power 8 outlets instead of 4\.
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/19dfd3c285d9cd9ff5e0cccf37147440bf6d657e.jpg)

8 relays to control the outlets.
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a94cb0d79ba7b883809fe9c52ae69bd90fc6d3f9.jpg)

Relays, modified outlets and 2 surge protectors... Boxes to house the components and connectors to clean up and protect all the connections:

There is nothing like standing on a ladder to solder connections!
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/28e561861c37e7c4a988a22c48d43ad83ee5f3c0.jpg)

Transistors to control the relays.

From bread board to Thru-hole soldering the back of the circuit board, I work with what I currently have.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a237778f-3f72-4e2f-aa02-b07cbe1d0f23.jpg)

Place it in a box with a 2.5mm power and a 50 pin d-sub connector, I can close the door and it can be easily serviced in the future.

Add two AC dimmers to the power box for digital control of 6" centrifugal fans for intake and exhaust. Notice this is where the current sensor is also mounted on the bottom of the box.

After the power, controller and sensors are installed it's time to program:

Then it's time to take a break from programming to handle the last bit of construction beginning with the sump/ reservoir/ planter box. This is where the water will drain from the aquarium into the substrate (clay pebbles) and nitrites (good bacteria) will collect to break down the ammonia (fish waste) into nitrates (plant food).

Notice the decline in the bottom for the water to flow down in the sump to reduce the amount of water needed inside of the tent. This will keep my humidity down to a minimum. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/57d08f9596137b3638a1ddf0ed69d3d7768a16b2.jpg)

I found some unused plexi sitting around and cut it to size to fit between the substrate and plastic inside the box.

Finish the outside with a torch to bring out the features of the wood and coat it with boiled lynseed oil to reduce moisture damage.

It's time to machine about 700 individual holes in this acrylic base. Start off with a drill press...
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/83e1948464927abae8fd41ebeacd4954ac69438c.jpg)

...and finish with the hand drill.

Sand the edges and seat it to ensure no damage to the 6mm plastic that will be fitted inside of the box.
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/afc85dd3be95ff2db20300beed51c70680d6e7e1.jpg)

Coming together nicely.

Let's put it in the tent to add the Hydroton and start the plumbing. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8170d34333ddd5e73be6cb60d86faab1724d63c4.jpg)

150L of expanded clay pebbles fill this 39"x 19" x 14" space perfectly!
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d257ce7155325e2984abea83e6d4057e5bdf5761.jpg)

Plumbing with 1" PVC for both the send and return.

(4) 1/2" outlets reduce the amount of pressure that may build up from the gravity fed return from the tank which is 4' above these pre drilled water dipensers.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05a102bb-cc76-4a55-9b7c-d041bb8480cb.jpg)

Water inlets to the tank are also 1/2" and provide clean water from the sump.
