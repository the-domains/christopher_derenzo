They have catered to world renowned performers from the all across the entertainment industry. One of my favorite accomplishments was to manage this facility for a number of years and then re-install the A/V system when they decided to renovate it and change the name from Eleven50 to Opera. I was asked to repair and use the existing components and improve upon those A/V systems. One of my final responsibilities was to build a floating DJ Booth that could be suspended 25' in the air by two 1/4 ton motors to allow the booth to be tucked away when the full stage was needed for special events. The end result was a 20' wide crescent that was light enough to lift, balance, and yet strong enough to support all equipment installed in it. My responsibilities were to manage, construct, rig and maintain entertainment components for the facility for approximately 5 years.

As a teenager I didn't realize that I would have started a career as a laborer by helping framers build homes. This in turn helped me understand the skeletons of structures. From small spaces to large, I have pulled more cable and installed more conduit than I can even imagine. This has provided me with an understanding of how those arteries should make it from one place to another and this helped me make predictions when channels are not clearly visible.

Climbing around in attics, basements or voids in between provided me with experience into other trades common practices. I have acquired an uncanny ability to trace things to their origin or their end, both in technology and in life.
