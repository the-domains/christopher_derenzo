Design and program a control board with an Arduino microprocessor to sense and operate multiple motors and solenoids to detect clearances and perform operations requested by a mobile device. Initially I had set it up with additional relays for the manual operation of stepper motors, actuators, and solenoids. These were controlled with a custom built remote to move 3'x3'x2' metal boxes around a 18' tall structure to deliver items stored inside of the unit at the push of a button. The unit would automate the rotation of the boxes to deliver a box to one of three access panels in a three story building. These boxes were called through an iOS application (SmartFinder) which had the saved items organized inside a user defined database.
