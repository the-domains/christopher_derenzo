> The Machine - I was tasked with reverse engineering two previous prototypes, one made out of wood and the other made with lightweight metal both had been programmed but neither functioned completely. Both machines much smaller than what the customer was looking for so I made a plan to build one structure which could be bolted together and was more durable and the remaining and were limited in proper support, however they effectively diplayed the purpose of the machine and left me The metal machine was run for a short period of time and were not functional after a few operations. I was asked to design stronger machine for testing and researching possibilities of making this a viable product. I worked to develop smoother and more efficient operations on this rendition. I initially set it up with manual operation of stepper motors, actuators, and solenoids with a custom built remote to control the unit until all of the clearances were in order. Then I built an automated system with an Arduino microprocessor and sensors that were installed all across the machine to detect those clearances and perform operations requested by the iOS device. I am currently the technology development director for its prototypical phases by continuing project consulting services.

Design and program a control board with an Arduino microprocessor to sense and operate multiple motors and solenoids to detect clearances and perform operations requested by a mobile device. Initially I had set it up with additional relays for the manual operation of stepper motors, actuators, and solenoids. These were controlled with a custom built remote to move 3'x3'x2' metal boxes around a 18' tall structure to deliver items stored inside of the unit at the push of a button. The unit would automate the rotation of the boxes to deliver a box to one of three access panels in a three story building. These boxes were called through an iOS application (SmartFinder) which had the saved items organized inside a user defined database.
