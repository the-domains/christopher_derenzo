# Conveyor Type Electro-mechanical system: (2012)

Construction of ~11' x 7' x 2' steel structure and installation of automated controls that will communicate with an iOS application (SmartFinder 2011)

> Combining the forces of steel and automation - I've created my first monster! Bwuah HA HAHA!!

**The Machine -** I was tasked with reverse engineering two previous prototypes, one made out of wood and the other made with lightweight metal, one had been programmed but neither functioned completely. I was asked to design a stronger machine for testing heavy loads over 2 tons and researching efficient methods to proceed past the prototyping stage. I made a plan to build a steel structure out of 2x4, 2x2, and 2" angle iron which could be bolted together for easier transportability and extended to 18' high after testing an 11' section. This was more durable in the end and provided me with a machine to test and gather data. I worked to develop smoother and more efficient operations on this version until limits were found. I initially set it up with manual operation of stepper motors, actuators, and solenoids with a custom built remote to control the unit until all of the clearances were in order. Then I built an automated system with an Arduino microprocessor and sensors that were installed all across the machine to detect those clearances and perform operations requested by the iOS device.

<article style=""><h1>Smart-Finder (2011)</h1><p>I used Objective C, TBXML, HTTPRequest, CoreData, CoreGraphics, CoreLocation, CoreMedia, MessageUI, DragonMobile (speech kit), RedLaser (barcode scanner), and InAppSettingsKit for iOS 3, 4 and 5.</p></article>

Design and program a control board with a micro-controller to sense and operate multiple motors and solenoids to detect clearances and perform operations requested by a mobile device. Initially I had set the board up with additional relays for the manual operation of stepper motors, actuators, and solenoids. These were controlled with a wired remote to move the 3'x3'x2' metal boxes around a 18' tall structure to deliver items stored inside of the unit at the push of a button. The last stage in prototyping was to efficiently automate the rotation of the boxes to deliver "the" box to one of two access panels in a two story building. These boxes were called through an iOS application (SmartFinder) which had the recalled items from a user defined database.

Let the counters begin!

I was actually proud of these jumps!

This is where we use that multi-meter over and over and over again;-)

Next stop, SMD's on printed circuit boards!

This was my "throw back" for a bit of nostalgia!
