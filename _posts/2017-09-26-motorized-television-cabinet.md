  This was a smart piece of furniture with all A/V equipment concealed behind
  the doors and a motorized television stand. Mr. Huskey requested a “classic”
  design that blended with the existing bedroom furniture. The intention was to
  conceal all of the components fashionably and have a motor move the television
  up through the counter top by the push of a button.
