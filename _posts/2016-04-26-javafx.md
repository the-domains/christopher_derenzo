# Fan Manager (2015)

JavaFX : A custom user interface for monitoring and controlling multiple motors and providing feedback to the UI from various sensors wirelessly

While taking Advanced Java (CS56) at SMC we were tasked with a group project for the semester to build an application to present to our fellow students and professor to be graded at the end of the semester. I voluntarily chose to be the lead in one of five groups and my job was to encourage others to join my team two weeks into the semester. While other leads pitched games and utilities, I pitched a program that would wirelessly communicate and control hardware. To my surprise 7 of my peers were as excited about this idea too and chose to follow me down this path. To begin we would meet for four hours to prepare our plans by researching what we would use to complete this project and provide our purpose to the class and professor...

To work together with others on something I enjoyed so much was an absolute joy to experience.

From the previous semester I had a workbench prototype I was building in the Engineering Club and wanted to run some verifiable tests, but did not have the software to control it and record it... Hence the "FanManager"/ "Workbench prototype controller"! I wanted to test for temperature and power in/ out from some easily accessible motors for use with LiFePO4 batteries.

So we mount a fan blade to the motor and viola!

Fan... Manager... (I hope your following me here ;)

Of course my hand drawings don't do the trick and my team is still like, Whaaaat?

So as the team became familiar with Java FX and the project we started to gather all of the bits and pieces that make up the whole eventually:

We found a great UI in Java that we could pick apart and learn from:

After all of the time we spent learning JavaFX we placed the machine across the room and proceeded to share with the class our successes and failures through this powerpoint.
