While taking Advanced Java (CS56) at SMC we were tasked with a group project for the semester to build an application to present to our fellow students and professor to be graded at the end of the semester. I voluntarily chose to be the lead in one of seven groups and my job was to encourage others to join my team two weeks into the semester. While other leads pitched games and utilities, I pitched an opportunity to program an application that would communicate with hardware. To my surprise 7 of my peers were as excited about this idea too and chose to follow me down this path. So to begin we met twice a week for one hour and formed our plans which we presented two weeks after we began...

To work together with others on something I was so passionate about was an absolute joy to experience.

From the previous semester I had a workbench prototype I was building in the Engineering Club and wanted to run some verifiable tests, but did not have the software to control it and record it... Hence the "FanManager"/ "Workbench prototype controller"! I wanted to test for temperature and power in/ out from some easily accessible motors for use with LiFePO4 batteries. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c0b4e727-0a7c-45bf-9c5f-4e039bd93b3a.jpg)

So we mount a fan blade to the motor and viola! 

Fan... Manager... (I hope your following me here ;) ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6e2ba7b20c9dd66448061bf6ab531d7c078b99aa.jpg)

Of course my hand drawings don't do the trick and my team is still like, Whaaaat?

Bits and pieces make up a whole eventually:

I found a great UI in Java that we could pick apart and learn from:

What was most challenging about this project was realizing that many students lacked the discipline to see this project through or make the effort.
